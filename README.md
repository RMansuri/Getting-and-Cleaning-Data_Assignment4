# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data_Assignment4
In This assignment we were given a zipped data files. First, we will need to unzip the data, rename the "UCI HAR Dataset" as "Data" folder name
and save the this folder in an appropriate location along with the the R code. 
The R code will generate two dataset i.e. merged_data.txt and data_with_means.txt. 
Once you run this command in R studio data <- read.table("data_with_means.txt") it will give you the average of each variable for respective 
activity and for respective subjects.
